    "A pedometer is a small electronic gadget that counts the number of steps taken by a person throughout the day. It is often worn on the waistline or fastened into clothing and detects motion and activity using a sensor. Pedometers are popular among health and fitness enthusiasts because they can provide a good measure of daily physical activity and help people track their progress toward fitness goals. Many current pedometers now include calorie counts, distance measurements, and heart rate monitors, making them much more useful for tracking general health and fitness.\n",

    "9 volts is more than any part of the Pico can handle. If you connect the battery directly you will damage the microcontroller. We need to use another component to convert the voltage to a range which the Pico can handle.\n",

    "Before running your pico from a battery, here is a question: how will we start the program without using Thonny? The pico needs to run without being connected to a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the trick we will use: when the Pico powers on, the first thing it does is check its memory for a file called main.py. If there is a file with that name, it runs the file. So there is our solution: make a file called main.py which starts the accelerometer program. Or just rename the file we already have. The important thing is that the file is called main.py, and it's actually stored on the pico.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing make sure you have your code starting whenever it gets connected to power. You should be able to plug the the microcontroller into any USB port and watch it start up automatically without doing anything on the computer.
