    "In the last couple of labs, we have explored the modulation of a signal by multiplying it with a periodic signal, such as a sine wave or a triangular wave. We have explored how this changes the sound by listening to it. It was observed that, when the frequency of the carrier is low compared to that of the sound, modulating a sound is perceived as a periodical increase/decrease of the volume of the sound. Mathematically, we say that such modulation modifies the \"envelop\" of the signal. The envelop of a signal represents the maximal/minimal values between which the signal oscillates over time. (Yeah, his is not very precise, but giving a precise mathematical definition would just be sonfusing at this point. -pm) So amplitude modulation, which as the name indicates changes the amplitude of the signal, naturally changes the envelop of the signal. When the carrier value is very small at some point in time, the amplitude of the modulated signal is decreased, thus making the sound less loud at that moment. Conversely, if the carrier value is very large at some point in time, the amplitude of the modulated signal is decreased, thus making the sound louder at that moment. "
