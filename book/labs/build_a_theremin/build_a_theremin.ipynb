    "In a previous lab, we made a synthesizer which works by playing precomputed samples of audio. That worked well for a synthesizer, where we only have a limited selection of notes to choose from. One of the main drawbacks of this approach is that we can't change the samples in response to user input. For example, if we wanted to play sounds with multiple waveforms at multiple volumes over a continuous range of frequencies, we would run out of memory very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will discover some of the problems with computing samples in real time, and share some strategies for overcoming those difficulties. This will culminate in building a musical instrument which we can play without touching, called a theremin. A traditional theremin works by detecting changes in capacitance, while ours will work by monitoring the timing of ultrasound signals."

    "To test that you have everything connected correctly and your components are working as expected, the file [component_test.py](https://github.com/TheDataScienceLabs/DSLab_Fourier/blob/main/book/labs/build_a_theremin/component_test.py) has been provided. When you run it, it should produce a stream of numbers. You should be able to change the first number by rotating the potentiometer. The second number should tell you the distance in centimeters from the ultrasonic distance sensor to the nearest hard flat object -- if no object is detected it will give `nan` instead. If either number does not change, figure out why and fix it before continuing."

    "There are two inputs to a Theremin. A theremin makes a pure tone with a frequency that changes from one input, and volume which changes due to the other input. Traditionally a user moves their hand over two metal probes changing the capacitance. This change in capacitance is mapped to frequency and volume at the two probes. A small distance corresponds to a high frequency or low volume, and a large distance makes a low tone or high volume at the respective probes. But instead of mapping the capacitance, we will be using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and map it to a range of frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it can be hard to coordinate multiple ultrasonic sensors at once, since they can hear each other. So, for volume, we will use the potentiometer instead. The highest signal we can send to the speaker is $2^{15}$ since it takes a signed 16 bit integer, and the potentiometer gives numbers between 0 and $2^{16}$ since it's an unsigned 16 bit integer. We will just take a sine curve and multiply it by the potentiometer value over 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set a high frequency of A5=880 Hz at 1 centimeter distance, and a low frequency of C4=262 Hz at 60 cm distance. That means at the high end a period of $\\frac{22050}{880} = 25 $ samples and at the low end a period of $\\frac{22050}{262}=84$ samples. For simplicity, we will interpolate linearly, giving the function \n",

    "The problem here is in the timing between taking the input and playing it through the speaker. Run the program [naive_theremin_timed.py](https://github.com/TheDataScienceLabs/DSLab_Fourier/blob/main/book/labs/build_a_theremin/naive_theremin_timed.py). This is almost identical, but it notes the current time before and after computing the tone. You will find that the tone takes anywhere from 2500 to 8000 microseconds to make. A 50 sample clip only takes $\\frac{50 \\text{samples}}{22,050\\text{ samples/second}}= 2200$ microseconds to play. That means that by the time the the I2S buffer is empty, we have not even finished coming up with the next sample. This is called **buffer underflow**.\n",

    "There are two ways to fix this. We can either compute the samples faster, or we can get ourselves more time to use for computing."

There is just one big loop in the code which generates the tone. let's try running that code on your computer. Your computer is much faster than the microcontroller, so it will be able to do it quicker, but we can still make useful comparisons by comparing with other code running on the same computer.\n",

    "The code we have written so far is written in a synchronous way. Execution proceeds from top to bottom, doing one line at a time. For every call to `audio_out.write`, there is one call to `make_tone`. While the code does one thing (making the tone to play) it cannot do anything else (writing the tone to the buffer). This works fine as long as there is plenty of time to go around. In our case, it means there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to solve this would be to change the ratio of calls to `audio_out.write` and `make_tone`, carefully including more of one or the other, and tweaking the size of the I2S buffer until we find the perfect balance.

    "### Understanding the asynchronous version\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code here is the same as before. There are a few differences, which we will discuss here.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tone = bytes(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "async def write_tone():\n",
    "    nonlocal tone\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "async def refresh_tone():\n",
    "    nonlocal tone\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of the asynchronous version is to allow these two routines (getting a new tone, and writing the current tone) to run independently of one another. However, they still need a way to share information between each other. That's the point of the variable `tone`. By declaring it as `nonlocal`, we can have `refresh_tone` write to the variable and `write_tone` read from the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions which run asynchronously need the special keyword `async` as part of their definition. This makes sure they are only called by asynchronous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "swriter = asyncio.StreamWriter(audio_out)\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    swriter.write(tone)\n",
    "    await swriter.drain()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All the hard work of managing the buffer is done by the `StreamWriter` object. We make a new `StreamWriter`, and write the tone to it. The special keyword `await` lets the interpreter go do other things until the condition it requires is met. In this case, the `drain` condition waits until there is enough room in the buffer to write the tone again.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the body of `refresh_tone` is exactly the same as before. The only things we have added are the `nonlocal tone` statement and the line `await asyncio.sleep(0.01)`. We have already explained what `nonlocal tone` does. The `await` statement here is not waiting for anything in particular to change, it's just waiting for a certain amount of time to pass. This gives time to the `write_tone` function to run. It's an added bonus that this keeps the tone generation loop from happening too frequently. We really won't move our hands fast enough for changes in less than a hundredth of a second to matter, and this lets the whole system do less work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "asyncio.run(asyncio.gather(write_tone(), refresh_tone()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final change we made. This is where the asynchronous functions actually get run. `gather` combines the two tasks into one big task, and `asyncio.run` sets them both in motion. Since they both have `while True` loops in them, they will keep going forever (until you tell them to stop).\n",
    "\n",
    "This system works so well because it allows `write_tone` to be called as many times as necessary to fill the I2S buffer, running the `refresh_tone` function only as often as needed. Because the buffer stays topped off, there is always enough time to compute the tone when we need it. All the load balancing is handled by the `asyncio` module!\n",
